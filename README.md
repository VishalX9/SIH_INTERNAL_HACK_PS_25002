_SafeTrail: Blockchain-based Tourist Identity & Safety Platform
SafeTrail generates a tamper-proof digital Tourist ID at trusted checkpoints like immigration, IRCTC, hotels, airlines, and toll booths. The ID is stored on blockchain and securely shared with tourists via SMS/email for login.

Key Features:
1. Verified Tourist ID → issued only at official checkpoints, ensuring authenticity.
2. Panic Button → instantly shares live location + ID with authorities for rescue.
3. Multilingual Support → interface and emergency communication in local + global languages.
4. Live Safety Map → real-time map of safe/unsafe zones, alerts, and crowd insights.
5. AI-based Anomaly Detection → flags unusual activity or scams to protect tourists.
6. Travellers Connect → verified tourists can connect safely with others nearby.
7. Lost & Found Support → link lost items with tourist ID for faster recovery.
8. Medical Support → pre-filled health info and emergency contacts accessible during crises.
9. Data for Governance → anonymized insights improve tourism policy & infrastructure_
